Files included:
README - the file you are reading right now
Makefile - contains targets for default, dist, and clean
lab3b.py - implementation of this project in python

Because I did not know python when I started this project, I
used tutorialspoint.com for many things when looking up syntax

I also used stackoverflow.com for several syntax and more specific/obscure
python questions.

I also used the manual on the ext2 file system that we were given for the
last project as a reference for the block offsets and the numbers
of the valid nodes.

The biggest problem I had with this project was that some of the values
needed to be casted to int before they would be usable for me since I was
using ints to cross reference against my data structures. It took me a
while to figure this out, but once I did, things started to work
