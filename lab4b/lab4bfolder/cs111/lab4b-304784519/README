lab4b.c is my implementation for lab 4b.

Research:
Most of the the information that I gathered for this project
came from tutorialspoint.com and stack overflow. The things
that I researched were predominantely syntax questions for c.
The other resources that I used were the provided guides on
how to use the gpio and aio mraa libraries in order to interact
with and get data from the beaglebone.

The issues that I had with this project were figuring out how
to handle the input from stdin and figuring out the mappings
of the different pins on the beaglebone. For the input, I 
ended up using two buffers, one for reading in the entire available
input after polling and the other for individual commands. If an
incomplete command comes in, the buffer for the commands retains 
what it had at the end of the last poll and is appended to in the
new cycle so that we can get the whole command before executing 
anything.
