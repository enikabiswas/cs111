Research:
Most of my time was spent debugging the socket part of my program,
so I used man7.org to answer my questions about this.

Also I had some trouble with connecting to the wifi with my beaglebone,
but eventually was able to fix it.

The other thing I had trouble with was sometimes I wouldn't write
my id to the socket before starting to do the processing, which would
cause the program to crash and I had no idea why because the error messages
I would get would not indicate this. However, I eventually figured out that
this was the case after checking the website for the server where it says
the status of each id's tests and mine would come up as not having reported
the id. After fixing this problem, my code ran fine.
