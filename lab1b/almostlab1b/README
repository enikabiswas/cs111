The primary resource that I used for this project were the man pages for the C language
(via man7.org) as well as stack overflow pages for syntax questions. I also used the
zlib reference manual to set up my inflation and deflation functions.

I also altered my design from lab1a because I was writing one character at a time across
the pipes and sockets. I changed this to writing the whole buffer at once, but traversing
through the buffer before doing so so that I could recognize when the special characters
were sent across.

The following are links to resources that I used to help me in this project:
