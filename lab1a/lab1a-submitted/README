For this project, I heavily leveraged the manual pages for each of the functions that
we needed to use for this project. 

man7.org and gnu.org were the most helpful for this project

The code has been somewhat refactored, but the main function is still a bit messy. 

I originally had everything in the main function, but not being able to read my code
became and issue as the prorgram grew, so I refactored and as far as I can tell, the
functionality remains the same.

There were some issues with where to register the signal handlers and where to send the
SIGINT kill signals, but eventually figured it out via using copious amounts of 
printf statements to debug
