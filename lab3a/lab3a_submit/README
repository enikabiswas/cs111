Included files:
lab3a.c - source code for the solution

README - this file

Makefile - file with the appropriate targets


Research:

I relied heavily on tutorialspoint.com for references about various c functions

I also based some of my functions off of functions that I found at:

https://www.epochconverter.com/programming/c

and

http://cs.smith.edu/~nhowe/262/oldlabs/ext2.html


Additionally, I used the included manual on the EXT2 file system
for information about the offsets and other info
